/*
Problem: Two Repeated Elements

You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. 
Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if X and Y are the repeating numbers, and X's second 
appearance comes before second appearance of Y, then the order should be (X, Y).

Solution:
*/
class Solution
{
    //Function to find two repeated elements.
    public int[] twoRepeated(int arr[], int n)
    {
        // Your code here
        HashSet <Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int res[] = new int[2];
        int j = 0;
        for( int i:arr){
            if(set.isEmpty())
                set.add(i);
            else if(set.contains(i)){
                res[j] = i;
                j++;
            }
            else{
                set.add(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
}
