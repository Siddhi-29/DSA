Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List.
When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.

Solution:
*/

class Solution
{
    //Function to remove duplicates from unsorted linked list.
    public Node removeDuplicates(Node head) 
    {   // Your code here
        Node curr = head;
        Node prev = null;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        while(curr != null){
            if(set.contains(curr.data)){
                prev.next=curr.next;
            }
            else{
                set.add(curr.data);
                prev=curr;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
