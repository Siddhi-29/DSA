/*
Problem: Check If Circular Linked List

Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not.
A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle.
An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Note: The linked list does not contains any inner loop.


Solution:
*/
class GfG
{
    boolean isCircular(Node head)
    {
	// Your code here	
	Node temp = head;
    Node curr = head;
    while(curr.next!= null){
        curr = curr.next;
        if(curr == temp){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
    }
}
