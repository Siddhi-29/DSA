/*
Problem: Next Greater Element
Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array
in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next 
greater of the last element is always -1.

Solution:
*/

class Solution
{
    //Function to find the next greater element for each element of the array.
    public static long[] nextLargerElement(long[] arr, int n)
    { 
        // Your code here
        
        Stack<Long> s=new Stack<Long>();
        long[] newarr= new long[n];
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            while(!s.isEmpty() && s.peek()<=arr[i]){
                s.pop();
            }
            
            if(s.isEmpty()){
                newarr[i]=-1;
            }
            else{
                newarr[i]=s.peek();
            }
            
            s.push(arr[i]);
        }
        return newarr;
    } 
}
