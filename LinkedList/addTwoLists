/*
Problem: Add two numbers represented by linked lists

Given two numbers, num1 and num2, represented by linked lists of size n and m respectively. The task is to return a linked list that represents the sum of these two numbers.

For example, the number 190 will be represented by the linked list, 1->9->0->null, similarly 25 by 2->5->null. Sum of these two numbers is 190 + 25 = 215, which will be represented by 2->1->5->null. You are required to return the head of the linked list 2->1->5->null.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Solution:
