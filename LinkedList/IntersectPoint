/*
Problem: Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists

Given two singly linked lists of size N and M, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

Solution:

*/

class Intersect
{
    //Function to find intersection point in Y shaped Linked Lists.
	int intersectPoint(Node head1, Node head2)
	{
        // code here
        int size1=0;
        int size2=0;
        int diff;
        Node curr1=head1, curr2=head2;
        while( curr1 != null){
            size1++;
            curr1 = curr1.next;
        }
        while( curr2 != null){
            size2++;
            curr2 = curr2.next;
        }
        curr1 = head1;
        curr2 = head2;
        if( size1>size2){
            diff = size1-size2;
            for( int i=0; i<diff; i++){
               curr1= curr1.next; 
            }
        }
        else{
            diff = size2-size1;
            for( int i=0 ; i<diff; i++){
                curr2 = curr2.next;
