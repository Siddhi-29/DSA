Given a string s without spaces, a character ch and an integer count. Your task is to return the substring that remains after the character ch has appeared count number of times.
Note:  Assume upper case and lower case alphabets are different. “”(Empty string) should be returned if it is not possible, or the remaining substring is empty.

Solution:
*/
class Solution {
    public String printString(String s, char ch, int count) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) == ch){
                count--;
            }
            if(count == 0){
                return s.substring(i+1);
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
}
