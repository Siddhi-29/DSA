Problem: Anagram

Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other. Strings a and b can only contain lower case alphabets.

Note:-

If the strings are anagrams you have to return True or else return False
|s| represents the length of string s.

Solution:
*/

class Solution
{    
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        char A[] = a.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(A);
        a = new String(A);
        
        char B[] = b.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(B);
        b = new String(B);
        
        return (a.equals(b));
        
    }
}
